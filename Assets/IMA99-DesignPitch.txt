For this semester, I aim to create a game from the Bullet Hell genre, taking influence mainly from the Touhou Project series. Bullet Hell games, at their simplest, involve a player character shooting a stream of bullets to destroy enemies while dodging bullets fired from enemies. The player character is usually easily killed, usually losing a life in one hit, but in return, the player typically has a small hitbox. Well-made bullet hells rarely ever feel unfair as the defeat can usually be traced back to the player's lack of skill instead of random effects.

Using Unity, a basic scene can be constructed by projecting an image over a plane as a background and floating objects over it. A bullet spawner object can be attached to the player and enemy objects to simplify trying to spawn bullets. Bullets themselves would be individual objects that travel through the scene at varying speeds. The player has a limited amount of lives that can be increased by picking up point items and their shot can increase in power by picking up power items, both of which can be dropped by destroyed enemies. Most enemies don't need visible lifebars, but midbosses and stage bosses can have their HP displayed at the top of the screen. This design seems manageable for a semester project, since the basic framework should be easy to set up and any extra time can be spent creating new patterns and stages. If the end of the semester creeps up on me, the game should be ready to be presentable at any point.
